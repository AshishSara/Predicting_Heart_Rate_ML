Ensemble Methods in Your Context:

Combine Linear Models and Tree-Based Models: You could create an ensemble that takes the average of predictions from a linear regression model and a Random Forest model. This may capture both linear and non-linear relationships in the data.

Weighted Average of Models Based on Performance: You could assign higher weights to models that perform better according to a particular metric (e.g., lower MAE).

Use Boosting: Given that Random Forest and Gradient Boosting individually show varying performance across different sheets, using a boosting method may improve overall performance.

Stacking with a Meta-Model: Train a meta-model (perhaps another linear model or a simple neural network) on the predictions of the initial models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.).

Stacking

How it works: Multiple types of models are trained on the same dataset. The predictions from all the models are used as inputs to train a final "meta-model" that makes the final prediction.
Advantages: Can capture complex underlying patterns in the data by leveraging the strengths of multiple models.
Revised Model Selection:
Random Forest: This model consistently performed well across the different sheets, offering the best or near-best MAE, MSE, and R2 scores. It's robust to overfitting and can capture complex relationships in the data.
Gradient Boosting: Although not always the best, this model often outperformed linear regression and was competitive with random forest. It can also capture complex patterns and is less prone to overfitting.
Linear Regression: It's a simple model that provides a baseline. Even though it didn't perform as well as the others, it has the advantage of interpretability and can sometimes capture trends that tree-based models miss.
Revised Meta-model:
The meta-model was changed to Random Forest because it consistently had the best performance metrics across the different data sheets. By using it as the meta-model, we aim to capture the best features of each base model while mitigating their individual weaknesses.
