Identifying Patterns and Anomalies Across Data Sheets
Introduction:
In the previous section, we established that the Random Forest model is the most consistent and reliable for predicting heart rate across multiple data sheets. In this section, we will delve deeper to identify any patterns or anomalies across these data sets that could inform model choice or indicate data quality issues.

Methods:
For this analysis, we look at the distribution of performance metrics (MAE, MSE, R2) across all data sheets for each model. We also identify any outliers or anomalies in these distributions.

Results:
Patterns:
Stability of Random Forest: The Random Forest model not only performed well but also showed less variation in its performance metrics across different sheets, suggesting a stable and reliable model.

Poor Performance of LSTM: The consistently poor performance of LSTM across all sheets may indicate that the nature of the data is not well-suited for sequence-based models.

Moderate Performance of ARIMA: This model showed neither exceptional highs nor lows but remained in the moderate range of performance, making it a potential secondary choice.

Anomalies:
High Errors in Specific Sheets for Linear Regression: Particularly for sheets id008, id029, and id030, Linear Regression had unusually high MAE and MSE, which could indicate issues like outliers, non-linearity, or high dimensionality.

Negative R2 Scores: Models like Gradient Boosting and Linear Regression sometimes had negative R2 values, questioning the model's fit to the data for those specific sheets.

Discussion:
Influence of Data Quality: The anomalies observed in the performance of Linear Regression on specific sheets suggest that data quality could be a significant factor influencing model performance.

Model Suitability: The consistently poor performance of LSTM suggests that it might not be suitable for this kind of data. The reason could be insufficient data points for the model to capture long-term dependencies or the inherently non-sequential nature of the data.

Fallback Options: While Random Forest emerges as the most reliable, ARIMA could serve as a reasonable fallback option but would require additional validation.

Conclusion:
The patterns and anomalies observed across different data sheets provide valuable insights into model suitability and potential data quality issues. Random Forest remains the recommended choice, but attention should be paid to data quality and model assumptions, particularly when high errors or negative R2 values are observed.

Future Work:
Detailed investigation into the data sheets that caused anomalies in model performance.
Exploring ensemble methods that combine the strengths of different models for more robust predictions.
